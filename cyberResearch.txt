Research major cybersecurity breaches over the past 20 years and pick one to write a short essay on.

    Facebook

Give an overview of what the breach was and the motivations behind it.

    In March 2021 hackers scraped through and 533,000,000 records were lost. This was due to a weak patch made in 2019. These millions of records were spread across 106 different countries and were posted onto a hacking forum. Data hacked included; names, phone numbers, user locations, biographical information, and email addresses.

Explain where the “tech flaws” were, and how hackers were able to breach their system.

    There was a patch that wasn't patched as good as it could've. Facebook is very hush-hush about the leaks that they have. They also brush it off by saying that it's normal and people should more or less expect things like that to happen.

What has the company done to protect against that vulnerability since?

    They say they fixed the issue and that the same route can no longer be used to scrape that data.
